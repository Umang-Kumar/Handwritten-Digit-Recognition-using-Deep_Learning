# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep_Learning
This project recognizes the handwritten numerical digits(0-9) that are drawn on the drawing window.
# Dataset
The dataset that I used is MNIST as it has a good number of training examples that allowed me to build a powerful and accurate model.

# Interface
The interface is designed using pygame to create an interactive window on which user can draw multiple digits one by one. Also pressing the key 'c' clears the window.
# How to use the project
Simply clone the repository and install all the packages in the requirements.txt file and run the interface.py file using python interpreter.
